Samuel worked on intial BFS implementation, and Alejandro 
worked on initial DFS implemenation. We completed and debugged each implementation 
together.
We wrote five test cases for each implementation (BFS and DFS) together, detailed
in the testing plan file.
We spent approximately 10 hours together in the same room. We used git extensively
to keep track of changes each of us made.
The final testing and completion of the project was done together at the PCL.
We both contributed a fair amount to each implementation, as well as to the
completion of the other functions (parse, print, etc.). We also both helped
write the team plan and test plan.
